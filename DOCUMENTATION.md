## 🧮 Mathematical Puzzle Chain

### Basic Version:
1. **Sum of first 5 primes** → Answer: 28
2. **28² - 100** → Answer: 684  
3. **√684** → Answer: 26
4. **3×26 + 22** → Answer: 100
5. **5! - 100** → Answer: 20

### Advanced Version (More Complex):
1. **7th triangular number** → Answer: 28
2. **Combinations C(28,2)** → Answer: 378
3. **Last 3 digits of 378²** → Answer: 884
4. **884 + sum of its digits** → Answer: 908
5. **908 mod 37** → Answer: 20

## 🎲 Treasure Box System

### Basic Version: 6 Boxes
- 1 Golden Treasure (WIN!)
- 2-3 Clues with encouraging messages
- 2-3 Humorous insults from pirates/creatures

### Advanced Version: 8 Boxes  
- 1 Legendary treasure (10,000 gold)
- 1 Rare treasure (5,000 gold) 
- 3 Wisdom clues
- 3 Humorous insults with pirate/sea themes

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Use the Launcher (Recommended)
```bash
