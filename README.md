### Project Description
A humorous web application that calculates the "failure rate" of a romantic proposal based on user inputs like names, genders, past relationships, and crush history, with AI-generated advice in Malayalam for a fun, culturally flavored touch.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world where love is a gamble, how do you know if your proposal will crash and burn? Fear not, for we solve the non-existent crisis of quantifying your romantic doom with precision!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our Proposal Failure Rate Calculator uses a tongue-in-cheek algorithm to predict your chances of rejection, factoring in name compatibility, gender dynamics, and past romantic misadventures, topped off with witty AI advice in Malayalam to either boost your ego or prepare you for heartbreak!
