### Project Description
A humorous web application that calculates the "failure rate" of a romantic proposal based on user inputs like names, genders, past relationships, and crush history, with AI-generated advice in Malayalam for a fun, culturally flavored touch.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world where love is a gamble, how do you know if your proposal will crash and burn? Fear not, for we solve the non-existent crisis of quantifying your romantic doom with precision!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
